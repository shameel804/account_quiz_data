      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "The rent expense of $5,000 is a fixed cost, while the raw material cost of $10 per unit is a variable cost. The total cost is calculated as follows: Fixed Cost = $5,000; Variable Cost = 500 * $10 = $5,000; Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost = $5,000 + $5,000 = $10,000."
    },
    "explanation": "The rent expense of ***$5,000 per month*** remains constant regardless of the number of units produced, making it a ***fixed cost***. The raw material cost of ***$10 per unit*** changes with production level, making it a ***variable cost***. To find the total cost: \n- Calculate variable cost: ```500 * 10 = 5000```\n- Add fixed cost: ```5000 + 5000 = 10000```\nThus, the total cost is ***$10,000***."
