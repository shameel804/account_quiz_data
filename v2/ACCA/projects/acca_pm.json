            "content": "**ABC Definition**: A costing method that assigns overhead costs to products based on the activities that drive those costs.\n\n**Key Differences**:\n| Aspect | Traditional Costing | ABC |\n|--------|---------------------|-----|\n| Cost allocation | Volume-based (labour hours, machine hours) | Activity-based (cost drivers) |\n| Overhead pools | Few, broad pools | Many, detailed pools |\n| Accuracy | May distort costs | More accurate product costs |\n| Complexity | Simple | More complex |\n| Best for | Simple operations | Complex, diverse products |"
        },
        "explanation": "Traditional costing can ***distort product costs*** when overheads are not driven by volume. ABC identifies ***cost drivers*** for each activity (e.g., number of setups, number of orders). This provides more accurate costs for ***pricing*** and ***product decisions***, especially where products have different complexity."

        "explanation": "Focusing on ***relevant costs*** improves decision quality by ignoring irrelevant information. A common error is including ***sunk costs*** (money already spent) or ***allocated overheads*** that won't change. ***Opportunity cost*** is often overlooked but can be crucial."
