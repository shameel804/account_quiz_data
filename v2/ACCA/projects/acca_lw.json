            "type": "text",
            "lang": null,
            "content": "**Five Essential Elements**:\n\n1. **Offer**: A clear proposal made by one party\n2. **Acceptance**: Unconditional agreement to the offer\n3. **Consideration**: Something of value exchanged between parties\n4. **Intention to Create Legal Relations**: Parties intend to be legally bound\n5. **Capacity**: Parties must have legal ability to contract (adults, sound mind, not bankrupt)"
        },
        "explanation": "Without these elements, there is ***no enforceable contract***. An offer must be distinguished from an ***invitation to treat*** (e.g., shop displays). Acceptance must be ***communicated*** and match the offer exactly (mirror image rule). ***Consideration*** need not be adequate but must have some value."

            "content": "**Offer**: A definite proposal capable of acceptance\n* *Example*: \"I will sell you my car for $5,000\"\n\n**Invitation to Treat**: An invitation to others to make offers - NOT an offer itself\n* *Examples*:\n  * Display of goods in a shop (*Pharmaceutical Society v Boots*)\n  * Advertisements (generally)\n  * Auction calls for bids (*Payne v Cave*)\n  * Company prospectus\n\n**Key Difference**: You cannot accept an invitation to treat - it merely starts negotiations."
        },
        "explanation": "This distinction is crucial because acceptance of an ***offer*** creates a contract, but responding to an ***invitation to treat*** is merely making an offer yourself. The case ***Fisher v Bell*** established that displaying goods in a shop window is an invitation to treat."

        },
        "explanation": "Consideration is the ***price of the promise*** - it's what distinguishes a contract from a gift. The rule about adequacy means courts don't rescue people from ***bad bargains***. The past consideration rule prevents people from claiming payment for ***unsolicited favours***."
