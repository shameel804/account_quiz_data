            "lang": null,
            "content": "**Sole Trader**: Owned by one person with unlimited liability. Simple to set up but owner is personally liable for all debts.\n\n**Partnership**: Owned by two or more people who share profits and liabilities.

Shareholders have limited liability (only lose their investment). More complex to set up with greater regulatory requirements."
