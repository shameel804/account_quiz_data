            "content": "**Direct Costs**: Costs that can be directly traced to a specific cost object (product, service, or department).\n* *Examples*: Raw materials for a product, wages of production workers\n\n**Indirect Costs**: Costs that cannot be easily traced to a specific cost object and must be allocated.\n* *Examples*: Factory rent, supervisor salaries, depreciation of machinery"
        },
        "explanation": "Understanding cost classification is fundamental to ***cost accounting***. Direct costs are ***variable*** with production volume, while indirect costs (overheads) are often ***fixed*** or ***semi-fixed***. This distinction affects how costs are ***assigned to products*** and how ***pricing decisions*** are made."

            "lang": null,
            "content": "**Fixed Costs**: Costs that remain constant in total regardless of production volume within a relevant range.\n* Total fixed cost stays same; per unit cost decreases as volume increases\n* *Example*: Rent of $10,000/month is the same whether you make 100 or 1,000 units\n\n**Variable Costs**: Costs that change in direct proportion to production volume.\n* Total variable cost increases; per unit cost stays constant\n* *Example*: Raw material at $5/unit means $500 for 100 units, $5,000 for 1,000 units"
        },
        "explanation": "Understanding cost behaviour is essential for ***budgeting***, ***pricing***, and ***decision-making***. In reality, costs may be ***stepped*** (fixed within a range) or ***semi-variable*** (containing both fixed and variable elements). The relevant range is important - fixed costs may change if production moves outside normal capacity."

            "content": "**Overhead Absorption Costing**: A method of allocating indirect costs (overheads) to products or cost units using a predetermined rate.\n\n**OAR Calculation**:\nOAR = Budgeted Overhead Costs / Budgeted Activity Level\n\n**Common bases for OAR**:\n* Direct labour hours\n* Machine hours\n* Direct labour cost\n* Units produced\n\n*Example*: If budgeted overheads are $100,000 and budgeted machine hours are 20,000, then OAR = $5 per machine hour"
        },
        "explanation": "Absorption costing ensures ***all production costs*** (including overheads) are included in the cost of products. This is required for ***inventory valuation*** under accounting standards. The choice of absorption basis should reflect the ***main driver*** of overhead costs. Under/over absorption occurs when actual activity differs from budget."

Fixed costs are treated as period costs and written off in full against profit.\n\n**Key Differences**:\n| Aspect | Marginal Costing | Absorption Costing |\n|--------|------------------|--------------------|\n| Fixed costs | Period cost | Product cost |\n| Inventory value | Variable cost only | Full production cost |\n| Profit when stock rises | Lower profit | Higher profit |\n| Use | Decision-making | Financial reporting |"
        },
        "explanation": "Marginal costing highlights the ***contribution*** each product makes toward fixed costs and profit. **Contribution = Sales - Variable Costs**. This approach is useful for ***short-term decisions*** like special orders or make-or-buy decisions. Absorption costing is required for ***external reporting*** under most accounting standards."

        },
        "explanation": "***Contribution*** is a key concept in marginal costing. Each unit sold contributes $20 toward covering fixed costs. Once fixed costs are covered, each additional unit sold generates $20 of ***profit***. The break-even point is where total contribution equals total fixed costs."

        },
        "explanation": "Standard costing is widely used in ***manufacturing*** environments. Standards should be ***attainable*** but ***challenging*** to motivate performance.

        },
        "explanation": "Material variances help identify whether inefficiency is due to ***paying more than expected*** (price variance) or ***using more than expected*** (usage variance).

        "explanation": "Labour variances are interconnected - using ***higher-paid skilled workers*** may cause adverse rate variance but ***favourable efficiency variance***.
