    },
    "explanation": "***Corporate tax*** is a tax imposed on the net income or profits of companies. It applies to business entities like corporations and firms.\n\n***Income tax*** is a tax levied on the earnings of individuals, including salaries, wages, and other sources of personal income.\n\nDifferences:\n- ***Corporate tax rate*** is usually fixed for businesses, whereas ***income tax*** is progressive (higher rates for higher incomes).\n- Individuals file ***income tax returns***, while businesses file ***corporate tax returns***.\n- Businesses can deduct operational costs to reduce taxable income, while individuals get tax exemptions through ***deductions and allowances***."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "Tax deductions lower taxable income by allowing certain expenses to be deducted, while allowances reduce the amount of income subject to tax."
    },
    "explanation": "***Tax deductions*** allow taxpayers to subtract eligible expenses from their total income, reducing the taxable amount. Examples:\n- ***Medical expenses***\n- ***Education expenses***\n- ***Charitable donations***\n\n***Tax allowances*** are specific amounts that reduce taxable income before applying tax rates. Examples:\n- ***Personal allowance:*** A set amount individuals can earn tax-free.\n- ***Housing allowance:*** A tax-free benefit for accommodation costs.\n\nUsing deductions and allowances effectively can significantly lower tax liability."

    "ques": "Why are direct taxes considered progressive while indirect taxes are often regressive?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "Direct taxes are progressive because they increase with income levels, whereas indirect taxes are regressive as they are levied uniformly, affecting lower-income individuals more."
    },
    "explanation": "***Direct taxes*** (e.g., income tax) are ***progressive*** because tax rates increase with income. Higher earners pay a larger proportion of their income.\n\n***Indirect taxes*** (e.g., sales tax, VAT) are ***regressive*** because they are charged at a fixed rate, meaning lower-income groups pay a larger percentage of their earnings on these taxes compared to wealthier individuals.\n\nFor example:\n- A ***10% VAT*** on basic goods affects a low-income earner more than a high-income individual, as a larger portion of their earnings is spent on essentials."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "Input tax credit allows businesses to claim credit for the GST/VAT paid on purchases and deduct it from the tax payable on sales."
    },
    "explanation": "The ***Input Tax Credit (ITC)*** mechanism prevents double taxation by allowing businesses to offset the tax paid on purchases against the tax collected on sales.\n\nExample:\n1. A manufacturer buys raw materials for ***$1,000*** and pays ***10% VAT ($100)***.\n2. The manufacturer sells the finished product for ***$2,000*** and collects ***10% VAT ($200)*** from the buyer.\n3. The manufacturer offsets the ***$100*** tax already paid and remits only ***$100 ($200 - $100)*** to the government.\n\nThis system ensures that only the ***value-added portion*** is taxed at each stage."

      "type": "text",
      "lang": null,
      "content": "Some taxes have characteristics of both direct and indirect taxes. For example, corporate income tax is a direct tax, but when companies pass the burden to consumers via higher prices, it behaves like an indirect tax."
    },
    "explanation": "***Direct taxes*** are paid directly to the government, and ***indirect taxes*** are passed on to consumers. However, some taxes blur the line.\n\nExample:\n- ***Corporate income tax:*** Initially, businesses pay it directly, making it a ***direct tax***.\n- ***However, businesses often pass this cost onto consumers*** by increasing product prices, making it behave like an ***indirect tax***.\n\nThis indirect impact is called ***tax shifting***, where businesses adjust their pricing or operations to compensate for tax burdens."

      "content": "Governments apply different GST/VAT rates based on the necessity of goods, economic impact, and social welfare considerations."
    },
    "explanation": "***Essential goods*** (like food, medicine) often have lower or zero tax rates to make them affordable.\n\n***Luxury goods*** (like cars, jewelry) attract higher taxes to generate more revenue and discourage excessive consumption.\n\nExamples:\n- Basic food items may have ***0% GST***.\n- Electronics might have ***18% GST***.\n- Luxury cars could have a ***28% GST rate***.\n\nGovernments use tax rate variations to control market behavior and ensure fairness."

    "explanation": "***Progressive taxation:***\n- Higher-income earners pay a higher percentage.\n- Example: Income tax where low earners pay ***10%***, middle earners pay ***20%***, and high earners pay ***30%***.\n\n***Proportional taxation:***\n- Everyone pays the same percentage, regardless of income.\n- Example: A ***flat tax of 15%*** applies to all taxpayers, whether they earn $10,000 or $1,000,000.\n\nMany governments prefer ***progressive taxes*** for social equity, while some countries adopt ***proportional taxes*** for simplicity."

      "content": "Depreciation allows businesses to recover the cost of assets over time by deducting a portion of their value annually, reducing taxable income."
