Balance\n- Total debits MUST equal total credits\n\n## Example Entry Breakdown\n\n```\nJan 20    Equipment                   10,000\n             Cash                                 4,000\n             Notes Payable                        6,000\n          (Purchased equipment, paid part\n           cash, balance on note)\n```\n\nThis is a **compound entry** - more than two accounts affected.\n\n> **Remember:** Debits on top, credits indented below!"
