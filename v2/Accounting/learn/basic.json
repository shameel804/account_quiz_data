In this lesson, you will learn the **core principles** that govern accounting worldwide.\n\n## What You Will Learn:\n- **The Accounting Equation** - The fundamental formula that balances every transaction\n- **Double-Entry System** - Why every transaction affects two accounts\n- **Accrual vs Cash Accounting** - Two different timing methods\n- **GAAP and IFRS** - The major accounting standards\n\n> **Did You Know?** Accounting dates back over 7,000 years! Ancient civilizations used clay tablets to record transactions.\n\n## Why These Principles Matter\n\n| Principle | Importance |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Accounting Equation | Ensures books always balance |\n| Double-Entry | Prevents errors and fraud |\n| Accrual Method | Shows true financial picture |\n| Standards | Enables comparison across companies |\n\nLet's begin your journey into accounting!"

Without them, there would be no consistency or comparability.\n\n## The Four Key Assumptions\n\n### 1. Going Concern\n**Assumption:** The business will continue operating for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Implications:**\n- Assets are recorded at historical cost, not liquidation value\n- Long-term assets are depreciated over useful life\n- If going concern is doubtful, must disclose\n\n### 2. Economic Entity\n**Assumption:** Business activities are separate from owner's personal activities.\n\n**Implications:**\n- Personal expenses cannot be business deductions\n- Each entity maintains its own records\n- Prevents commingling of funds\n\n### 3. Monetary Unit\n**Assumption:** All transactions are recorded in a single, stable currency.\n\n**Implications:**\n- Transactions are measured in dollars (or local currency)\n- Non-monetary items (like employee morale) are not recorded\n- Ignores effects of inflation\n\n### 4. Periodicity\n**Assumption:** Business life can be divided into time periods for reporting.\n\n**Implications:**\n- Financial statements prepared monthly, quarterly, annually\n- Allows for timely decision-making\n- Requires estimates and adjustments\n\n> **Foundation:** These assumptions underpin all accounting practices!"
