Current Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n```\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- Measures ability to pay short-term debts\n- Higher is generally better\n- Too high may indicate inefficient asset use\n\n**Benchmark:** Generally, 1.5 to 3.0 is healthy\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test)\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n```\n\n**Why exclude inventory?**\n- Inventory is least liquid current asset\n- May be difficult to sell quickly\n- May be obsolete\n\n**Benchmark:** Generally, 1.0 or higher is healthy\n\n### 3. Cash Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nCash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities\n```\n\n**Most conservative** liquidity measure.\n\n## Example Calculation\n\n```\nCurrent Assets: $200,000\nInventory: $50,000\nCash: $40,000\nCurrent Liabilities: $100,000\n\nCurrent Ratio = $200,000 / $100,000 = 2.0\nQuick Ratio = ($200,000 - $50,000) / $100,000 = 1.5\nCash Ratio = $40,000 / $100,000 = 0.4\n```\n\n> **Liquidity is survival** - without it, companies fail!"
